This release adds the __OCaml/Menhir__ backend, a variant of the OCaml backend that uses parser generator `menhir` instead of `ocamlyacc`.  Beyond that, the focus of this release has been increased __robustness and predictability__ of the BNFC tool:
* New option `--check` that only performs sanity checks on the given LBNF grammar file, without calling any backend ([#286](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/286)).
* New sanity checks ([#186](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/186), [#213](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/213), [#214](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/214)) and deprecation warnings.
* Error messages of BNFC concerning rule or category names are now equipped with the error location.
* Generated code systematically tries to avoid clashes with language keywords or standard library names ([#278](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/278), [#289](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/289)).
* Pragma `define` now supported by all maintained backends (Agda, Haskell, Haskell/GADT, C, C++, Java).
* Pragma `position token` now supported by all maintained backends with the exception of C++/NoSTL.
* List separators consisting just of whitespace are now accepted. They are used in the generated printers but treated like "" in the generated parsers ([#70](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/70)).

The __Haskell backend__ has seen the following improvements:
* New option `--text-token` to use `Data.Text` instead of `String` in the generated lexer ([#167](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/167)).
* Deriving `IsString` instances for `Ident`-like token types ([#192](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/192)).
* The `Err` monad is now defined as `Either String`.  Module `ErrM` is only generated for backwards compatibility.  Imports of `ErrM` with an explicit import list may have to modified slightly, see a migration guide at the [Haskell backend documentation](https://bnfc.readthedocs.io/en/v2.8.4/user_guide.html#haskell-backend).
* Block comments delimiters are no longer restricted to 2 characters.

The __C-family backends__ have been improved as follows:
* C, C++, Java: Now multiple block comment forms per grammar are allowed ([#202](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/202)).
* C++/STL: The parser now throws an exception when parsing fails ([#288](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/288)).
* Java/JFlex: Special characters are properly escaped ([#299](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/299)).
* Java/ANTLR: Start rules are generated to work around ANTLR issue [#2689](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/2689) ([#272](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/272)).

Building of BNFC 2.8.4 requires __GHC â‰¥ 7.10__ and has been tested up to GHC 8.10.2.  BNFC can be build using `cabal` or `stack` (using one of the enclosed `stack-x.y.z.yaml` files).

#### Binaries:
* BNFC-2.8.4-mac.pkg: Binary `/usr/local/bin/bnfc` compiled under Mac OS X Mojave, x86 64bit processor
* bnfc-2.8.4-win.exe: Binary compiled under Windows 10, x86 64bit processor
