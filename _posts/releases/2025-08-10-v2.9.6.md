* C: preserve case in constructors (union): e.g. label `EInt` now is union member `eInt_` rather than `eint_`
  [[#479](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/479)]
* Haskell: lex ASCII 222 as upper rather than lower case letter
  [[#497](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/497)]
* Haskell: no longer derive `Typeable` (obsolete since GHC 7.10)
  [[#503](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/503)]
* Haskell: drop support for GHC 7, generated code needs at least GHC 8.0

Builds with GHC versions:
* with `cabal`, GHC 8.0 - 9.12
* with `stack`, GHC 8.4 - 9.12
