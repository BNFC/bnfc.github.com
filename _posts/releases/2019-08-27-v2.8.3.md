Main new feature:
* Agda backend: generates bindings to output of Haskell backend

Backend-independent features:

* GHC 8.8 compatibility
* Stack installation supported by provided `.yaml` files [[#198](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/198)]
* Unicode support in lexer, excl. C, C++ and Ocaml [[#249](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/249)]
* LBNF: support `\r` (carriage return) and `\f` (form feed) in token declaration [[#257](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/257)]
* LBNF: allow numbered categories (like `Foo2`) independent of coercions [[#210](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/210)]

C backend:

* supports now the `-l` option to give error locations [[#238](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/238)]
* correct function names in generated skeletons [[#239](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/239)]
* handle regular expression difference (subtraction) correctly [[#237](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/237)]

Haskell backend:

* generates now more fine-grained `Makefile` that invokes `bnfc` on changed `.cf` file
* uses qualified import of AST in generated printer [fixes [#128](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/128),[#228](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/228)]
* printer code no longer produces deprecation warning concerning `OverlappingInstances` [[#233](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/233)]
* `--cnf`: fixed problem with `Any` type in generated code [[#216](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/216)]
* `--cnf`: generated test program now same name (`Test`) as without `--cnf`
* `--glr`: correct module header in .y file [[#252](https://github.com/BNFC/bnfc/issues/252)]

Binaries:
* BNFC-2.8.3-mac.pkg: Binary `/usr/local/bin/bnfc` compiled under Mac OS X Mojave, x86 64bit processor
* bnfc-2.8.3-win.exe: Binary compiled under Windows 10, x86 64bit processor
