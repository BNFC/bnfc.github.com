Build:
- autoconf
  - verify Alex version.
- tidy up Makefiles a bit
  - and the generated ones too.
    - Use "Makefile" everywhere.
  - follow UNIX conventions...

Functionality:

- Add Bool type.

Bugs:
- Strange unicode space.
- Bison only supports 1 parser per input file.
- Write some clear docs on the Java backend.
- Java backend (and probably others)
  - Need to munge Java keywords like "abstract" "private"
    - Alfa.cf, C.cf fail to compile for this reason.
  - I think I fixed this, but it should be verified (peteg)
  - Add a message on how to run the test file (after a succesful compliation), 
    e.g. :
    "to run the test, type : java JavaletteLight/Test <filename>"
Compilers:

- write a JavaCup script

Bug Reports:

--------------
> Fail: formats/java/CFtoJavaPrinter.hs:269: Non-exhaustive patterns in function> getCons
  on Prolog.cf
  Reason: No separator for a list. The same happens in C and C++.

Java backend

If a terminal and non-terminal have the same name, there is a name clash in
the generarted .java files.

Solution: don't do this.
See C.cf for an example. Alfa.cf doesn't work either.

- "separator", etc. decs don't play nice.
  - the list stuff is emitted before the top-level non-terminal.
- need to specify which non-terminal is the top-level one.
  - i.e. a "start with" line must be present.
  - BNFC now crashes if you don't specify an "entrypoint" pragma,
    or use more than one.

Somewhere along the line of BNFC/jlex/jcup the BNFC comment-instruction
(comment "/*" "*/" ;) seems to fail. A file containing only an opening
of a comment manages to pass the parser without any trouble.

Aarne, Java:

  to get "parse successful" is fast, but then it takes
  quite some time to pretty-print

  the parser gets confused with isolatin characters included
  in string literals

Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho:

- A token UIdent declaration (see report) causes a mysterious parse
  error at end of file / perhaps conflicts with predefined Ident?
- If I use "\\/" in a production, Happy is unhappy (you use \/ as the
  Happy token)
- You generate Alex 1.x source.  Could you make it (optionally?)
  generate Alex 2.x source? <peteg: fixed>

Oh, and bnfc returns an exit code indicating success even when there is
an error.

Bjorn Bringert:

- Specifying coercions etc. for non-existing categories should
  probably be an error.
- Repeated identical rules should be an error.
- Java CUP back end does not support multiple entrypoints.
